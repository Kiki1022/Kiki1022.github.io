My name is Kinnari Shah. Welcome to "my space". I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I was raised in Lexington, Kentucky. I've been in Atlanta for 10 years now. I've been a makeup artist for a few different well know brands.  Bobbi Brown, Cle de Peau, and Trish Mcevoy. Due to the pandenimc I am temporarily layed off. Last year I was curious about changing my career...Becuase I am not working right now, this is a perfect time to start something new.  

I am looking forward to this journey and what it has to offer. The first week of school was excitng and stressful. It feel good to know that I have all kinds of support to assist me with the program. I am signing off now.  Going to indulge in a yummy chocolate cupcake I made yesterday.
