For my 4th module at Flatiron School I was introduced to Javascript. One of the first things I enjoyed about Javascript included DOM manipulation. Yup that’s right, I really enjoyed browsing websites and changing the inner HTML to whatever I wanted it to say! Oh and it was a big hit with my  6 year old nephew…I convinced him there was a Pokemon character named after him! 

Although Javascript may not have the elegance of the Ruby language or the strutcture and flow of the Rails framework, I  appreciated Javascript for making it possible to create a single page web application!  My project, called InstaLunch, is a single page web application where users can post pictures of anything food related! A user can submit their username, image_url  and a caption to create a post.  

InstaLunch has two models, a Cuisine model and Post model. The relationship is that a cuisine has many posts and a post belongs to a cuisine.  Out of the CRUD actions, a user can perform the create, read and delete actions on my web application. My web app also makes 3 asynchronous calls to the database (“GET”, “POST” and “DELETE) and uses JSON as the communication format. 
Not only was it my first time creating a single page Rails-API web application but I also have a new found appreciation for its simplicity from a user standpoint. I would like to present to you InstaLunch! Happy Posting! https://github.com/Kiki1022/instalunch.git
