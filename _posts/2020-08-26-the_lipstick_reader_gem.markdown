#The Lipstick Reader Gem
In my 10 years of working in the cosmetic industry for high-end retail I have seen many things over the years. One I have experienced more recently is clients asking me to find them a lipstick that is gluten free or vegan for instance. How do I feel about this? Well I actually love that there are more options out there that a client can choose from.  Do I know any peanut free lipsticks off the top of my head?? No! However I can name you the top matte red lipsticks in the industry!

Things brings me to how I came up with the idea for my CLI project. When I saw that there was an API website for cosmetics, I knew it was for me! I was really thrilled to create a CLI that can give a client a variety of menu options. This includes clients that have no preference or requirments for the lipstick and the client that would like to know about a lipstick that meets their criterea.  Once you enter in your options, it will take you to the brand name, lipstick line, and product link to further explore the product. 

Imagine how an app like this would make it easier for makeup artists (like me) who are approached by clients with specific preferences ro wanted to know about all the brands available for them to choose from. I wouldn't have to run and hide anymore!

The clients would love this kind of app as well. It can give them more freedom to explore on their own and order the products their choice. Now I invite you to try out the app for yourself here below!
