I was super excited to do my Sinatra Crud Project on building a web application for Makeup Artists. Being one myself, I know the challenges of clienteling especially if you are a 3rd party or free lance makeup artist visiting in a department store that does not provide a way for you to to capture your client's information after you've connected and built a relationship with them. This web application will allow a makeup artist to create a client profile and store their information. 

The framework for my Sinatra Project was made possible thanks to the Sinatra App Generator and includes the following: HTML, CSS, Ruby, SQLITE3, Sinatra, ActiveRecord. 
	 
 This is the information you can store for your clients(all are required to successfully create new client object):
*          Client Name
*          Client Email Address
* Client Event( Formal Affair, Photo Session, Day Look, Night Out.)       
* Client Rate(will be provided by the makeup artist to client for makeup application)
	
In the near future I plan to add more attributes to the Client class so the makeup artist can store more detailed information. I also plan to add more attributes to the User class so the user(makeup artist) can create a profile for themselves. For example a profile picture and a bio.
        
Happy clienteling!
